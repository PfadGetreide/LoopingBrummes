# Looping Brummes
Looping Louie is a game of skill for children produced by Milton Bradley since 1994 (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Looping_Louie">Wikipedia</a>).
Abused and very popular among alcoholics at parties, was it my intention to modify and personalize this game.
The outcome is called "Looping Brummes". The main function of this mod is to control the speed of the little guy
flying in circles. In addition there is the possibility to randomize the speed and even the direction.
