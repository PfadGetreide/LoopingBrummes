# Looping Brummes
Looping Louie is a game of skill for children produced by Milton Bradley since 
1994 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loopin'_Louie">Wikipedia</a>).
Abused and very popular among alcoholics at parties, was it my intention to 
modify and personalize this game.The outcome is called "Looping Brummes". 
The main function of this mod is to control the speed of the little guy flying 
in circles. In addition there is the possibility to randomize the speed and even
the direction.

This repository mod consist of the following:
<ul>
  <li>KiCAD files for the PCB</li>
  <li>source code for the controls</li>
  <li>3D-models for the case and the lighting mod</li>
</ul> 

# KiCAD
One part of the project is a custom PCB containing a DC-motor controller, a 
step-up converter needed for more speed, a SSD1306 display, a rotary encoder for
menu navigation and a place to solder down a RaspberryPi Pico.

# Source Code
The code is pretty much a mess and still under construction.But it works :)
Any tips are welcome.

**WHY WOULD YOU NEED AN IMAGE OF CODE HERE?**

# 3D-models
The models are the case with a top and bottom piece and a mod to hide a LED strip
on the base of the Looping Louie.
For the case, you will need 4 M4 heat inserts and 4 M4x10 screws.
